# 96flashbacks

This repo contains a modified decompilation of Super Mario 64 which aims to interpret a late development build of the game.

Please contribute first to the [development branch](https://github.com/96flashbacks/pre-e3/tree/development/). Things will be merged to the main branch once enough changes have been added for a new release.
